        I can't remember anything <br>
        Can't tell if this is true or dream<br>
        Deep down inside I feel the scream<br>
        This terrible silence stops me<br>
        <br>
        Now that the war is through with me<br>
        I'm waking up, I cannot see<br>
        That there's not much left of me<br>
        Nothing is real but pain now<br>
        <br>
        Hold my breath as I wish for death<br>
        Oh, please, God, wake me<br>
        <br>
        Back in the womb, it's much too real<br>
        In pumps life that I must feel<br>
        But can't look forward to reveal<br>
        Look to the time when I'll live<br>
        <br>
        Fed through the tube that sticks in me<br>
        Just like a wartime novelty<br>
        Tied to machines that make me be<br>
        Cut this life off from me<br>
        <br>
        Hold my breath as I wish for death<br>
        Oh, please, God, wake me<br>
        <br>
        Now the world is gone, I'm just one<br>
        Oh, God, help me<br>
        Hold my breath as I wish for death<br>
        Oh, please, God, help me<br>
        <br>
        Darkness<br>
        Imprisoning me<br>
        All that I see<br>
        Absolute horror<br>
        I cannot live<br>
        I cannot die<br>
        Trapped in myself<br>
        Body, my holding cell<br>
    
        Landmine<br>
        Has taken my sight<br>
        Taken my speech<br>
        Taken my hearing<br>
        Taken my arms<br>
        Taken my legs<br>
        Taken my soul<br>
        Left me with life in hell<br>
        <br>
